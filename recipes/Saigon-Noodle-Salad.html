        <h4>Directions: </h4>
        <ol>
            <h5> Step 1<strong></strong></h5>
            <p>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</p>
            <h5><strong>Step 2</strong></h5>
            <p>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</p>
            <h5><strong>step 3</strong></h5>
            <p>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dealer's Choice:</h3>
        <p>Dressing can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 5 days.

            You can use sambal oelek chile pepper sauce or red pepper flakes in place of Sriracha, if that better fits your tastes.
            
            Any leftover grilled meat works well in this salad: shrimp, pork, or chicken are all great options.
            
            The salad is very flexible; try adding julienned red or yellow pepper, pea pods, baby bok choy, or substitute sliced romaine lettuce for the cabbage.</p>
